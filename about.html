     Hello! Welcome to Origami Designs
     <hr>
     Our goal is to show more people how to make 
     origami while helping them improve their 
     skills and promoting artists and others in 
     the international paper folding community.  
     <br>

     If you’ve never folded anything before and want 
     to learn how, we have an excellent guide for beginners
     We have a giant database of free diagrams and much more!
